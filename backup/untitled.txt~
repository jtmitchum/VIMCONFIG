"of course it will," he said, thinking he'd not only passed the test of believing in her imagination, but also demonstrating his ability to remain in reality - the rock she'd surely need down the road. His head rested over her shoulder, sweat beading from his brow and body and a hand on her hip as if to support her - only she was laying down. 

Her eyes were warm with a love she'd never expected to feel in her life time. It wasn't from the man residing in her bed, nor the barely formed cluster of cells she imagined gently rocking in her womb, but something external to her presence - to her time. Her head turned down as if to see a quiet babe resting in her arms, she unintentionally ignored her husband's ill statement, though most she noted and retained in a growing bolus of disappointment. 

Someone was indeed holding her tight, but her husband's grasp was the last thing she would have noticed if she had been paying attention at all. Call it the human condition, call it hope or label it a dream, but a clear truth was simply missed in the moment - her gratitude was to awesome to realize the price paid. Then again, faith is a comforting disposition and well equipped to mislead otherwise scientific minds.
