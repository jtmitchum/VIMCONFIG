Alfred Extension: Unit Conversion using ruby library

Boom sucks - make a better boom. It would be a way better idea tracker with some thought. 

Function to flip keys as an Alfred Extension

This is a way to start getting traffic to your blog - so do it - and make sure you come up with some more engineering solutions rather than just pudsy productivity nonsense. 

fix the esc key for vim - double i is not working for you!!!!

Add key command to edit .vimrc - consider tmuxinator setup for it?
 
 You were adding a tmuxinator script to make dreamhost sshing more reasonable. Then you wanted better alias commands of tmuxinator - you also wanted oh my zsh and vimrc configs on dreamhost - might as well use it. 



iamhigh command - gem maybe - for osx - see about expansion later. I get high and make a lot of tangents while researching an original project. It would be nice to set a command line app - iamhigh <commands> file (or some form of output). original idea - browser history and command line history - timestamped if possible.

*  simple name - jt in one style and mitchum in a slightly different style
*  drop shadow text blocks of some sort - debate light and dark layouts - maybe both depending on viewer preference?
*  Some creative way to expose options - what all do you want to share ?
*  Code packages - syntax highlight - consider style this
*  Lab writeups- things I've done in school - acts as proof of work done - even if it's menial = put it up there! (go back to C programming )
